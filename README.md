# 👋 About Me

🚀 I’m currently working on:  
Enhancing my skills in **Full-Stack Development, Cloud Computing (Azure), Data Science, and Machine Learning** by building innovative projects in **Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Mobile App Development**.

🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on:  
Projects involving **Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, Cloud-based Applications, and React Native Mobile Development**.

🙋‍♂️ I’m looking for help with:  
- Optimizing **ML/DL models** for better real-world deployment.  
- Improving my **knowledge in advanced cloud solutions** (Azure, AWS).  
- Exploring **AR/VR integrations** in assistive technology.  

🌱 I’m currently learning:  
- **React Native and Flutter** for cross-platform app development  
- **Deep Learning architectures** for computer vision tasks  
- **Cloud Identity & Cybersecurity practices** with Azure IAM  

💬 Ask me about:  
- Full-stack web development (React.js, Node.js, Flask, Express.js)  
- Cloud solutions (Azure, AWS basics)  
- Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI-driven projects  
- GPA/CGPA calculators & automation apps  

⚡ Fun fact:  
I presented a **Sign Language Detection System using Deep Learning** at an International Conference (ICAICS 2025), showcasing real-time gesture recognition and emotion classification for assistive communication.
